| * <<BR-01,BR-01>>       
| Vertical Tables - Matching
| To Parse vertical tables, service must read the first column which should exactly match the searchTerm.

| FR-02 [[FR-02]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>>       
| Vertial Tables - multiple columns
| While paring vertical Tables, service must collect all columns in the row after the first column (heading) as values (list)

| FR-03 [[FR-03]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>>       
| Vertial Tables - merge cells
| While paring vertical Tables: If the next row has an empty heading column, we expect this to be a merged heading and read the values as well.

| FR-04 [[FR-04]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>> 
 * <<BR-02,BR-02>>
 * <<BR-03,BR-03>>       
| General - avoid single value arrays
| If in sum we just get one value, we transform it to a single string insted of a list.

| FR-05 [[FR-05]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>> 
 * <<BR-02,BR-02>>
 * <<BR-03,BR-03>>       
| General - avoid collecting empty
| In general we don't want to parse Empty Rows and Tables.

| FR-06 [[FR-06]]
| * <<BR-02,BR-02>>      
| Horizontal Tables - Matching
| If a Horizonal Table contains all Headings defined in the search criteria, the values of the columns will be parsed into multiple objects.

| FR-07 [[FR-07]]
| * <<BR-04,BR-04>>   
* <<BR-03,BR-03>>     
| Substructures Support
| We support substructures as ":" match type within table matches. If no resultName is defined, it will be integrated into the higher level structure.

| FR-08 [[FR-08]]
| * <<BR-05,BR-05>>      
| Transformation - split to list
| To describe the transformation via split into a flat list we use the following for the value:
