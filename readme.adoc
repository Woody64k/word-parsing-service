= Word Parser Service

== Setup

.Example for testing
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t word-parser-api:1.1.1 .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e API_KEYS='0815, 12' -e ENABLE_SWAGGER_UI='true' word-parser-api:latest
----

URL to call swagger-ui is: http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html
[TIP]
====
When running in docker while connected to vpn, *localhost* may not work. (therefore 127.0.0.1)

| Lists all apiKeys which will have access to the endpoint. They will be referenced in performance and access logs.
*Default*: no default set, but the application will crash without given api key

| ENABLE_SWAGGER_UI
| true
| If set to true this will enable the UI of swagger to test the endpoint and call it manually. (its recommented to have this as *false* in production)
*Default*: *false*

| FR-01 [[FR-01]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>>       
| Vertical Tables - Matching
| To Parse vertical tables, service must read the first column which should exactly match the searchTerm.

| FR-02 [[FR-02]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>>       
| Vertial Tables - multiple columns
| While paring vertical Tables, service must collect all columns in the row after the first column (heading) as values (list)

| FR-03 [[FR-03]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>>       
| Vertial Tables - merge cells
| While paring vertical Tables: If the next row has an empty heading column, we expect this to be a merged heading and read the values as well.

| FR-04 [[FR-04]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>> 
 * <<BR-02,BR-02>>
 * <<BR-03,BR-03>>       
| General - avoid single value arrays
| If in sum we just get one value, we transform it to a single string insted of a list.

| FR-05 [[FR-05]]
| * <<BR-01,BR-01>> 
 * <<BR-02,BR-02>>
 * <<BR-03,BR-03>>       
| General - avoid collecting empty
| In general we don't want to parse Empty Rows and Tables.

| FR-06 [[FR-06]]
| * <<BR-02,BR-02>>      
| Horizontal Tables - Matching
| If a Horizonal Table contains all Headings defined in the search criteria, the values of the columns will be parsed into multiple objects.

| FR-07 [[FR-07]]
| * <<BR-04,BR-04>>   
* <<BR-03,BR-03>>     
| Substructures Support
| We support substructures as ":" match type within table matches. If no resultName is defined, it will be integrated into the higher level structure.

| FR-08 [[FR-08]]
| * <<BR-05,BR-05>>      
| Transformation - split to list
| To describe the transformation via split into a flat list we use the following for the value:
[source,json]
----
{
  "searchTerm": "Zeiten",
  "resultName": "zeiten",
  "transform": {
    "split": {
      "by": "/",
      "as": "list"
    }
  }
}

  * <<BR-07, BR-07>> 
| Transformation - split to struct
| To describe the transformation via split into a a struct.

  "searchTerm": "Maße",
  "resultName": "meassure",
  "transform": {
    "split": {
      "by": ",",

      "values": [
        {
          "position": 1,
          "resultName": "length"
        },
        {
          "position": 2,
          "resultName": "with"
        },
        {
          "position": 3,
          "resultName": "hight"
        },
        {
          "formPosition": 4,
          "resultName": "additionlSizeInformation"
        }

    }
  }

| Layout Tables
| Sometimes Tables are used for Layouting and contain values such as other Tables, headings and other structures. These should be handled by parsing these columns in the same way like the document and embed them.
If possible leave the cells as string if they just contain text.

| FR-11 [[FR-11]]
| * <<BR-08, BR-08>>
* <<BR-02, BR-02>>
| Define default values
| In the Request it's possible to define default values. These may have any type and will be setted, if the value is 'null' after parsing.  
----
{
  "searchTerm": "Maße",
  "resultName": "meassure",
  "default": "0cm x 0cm x 0cm"
}
----

| FR-12 [[FR-12]]
| * <<BR-09, BR-09>>
| Parse full chapter below Heading
| To Read a chapter we will combin all headings of a block and all texts separated by a newline. We will ignore tables while reading a chapter.
